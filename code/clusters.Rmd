# the kmeans return object encapsulates numerous params including

# notice that withinss (and therefore the  cluster IDs) is not necessarily ordered
# by magnitude.
# better logic to enable cluster comparison across weeks:
#
# check cluster assignments for positions 1-2-3,  4-5-6, 8-9-10
# I propose that positions 1-2-3 will likely be in the same cluster
# as will positions 8-9-10.
#
# for positions 1-2-3 (expected typical cluster ID is '1')
# if "no matches" then no cluster assignment changes
# if at least 2 matches of '1', then no cluster assignment changes
# if at least 2 matches of '3', 
#                             change every instance (for all positions) of '3' to '1', 
#                             change every previous instance of '1' to '3'
# if at least 2 matches of '2', 
#                             change every instance (for all positions) of '2' to '1', 
#                             change every previous instance of '1' to '2'
# 
# for positions 8-9-10 (expected typical cluster ID is '3')
# if "no matches" then no cluster assignment changes
# if at least 2 matches of '3', then no cluster assignment changes
# if at least 2 matches of '2', 
#                             change every instance (for all positions) of '2' to '3', 
#                             change every previous instance of '3' to '2'
# if at least 2 matches of '1', then no changes (this probably means that the clusters 
# are totally scrambled)
# 
# note that this logic breaks if the true cluster for both groups 1-2-3 and 
# 8-9-10 is '1' or '3' (very unlikely)
